# AI Models for Tutor: Datasets Overview

This document outlines the datasets compiled for three AI applications designed for tutor use:

1. *Course Content Suggestions:* Assisting tutors in creating engaging course content by suggesting topics, structuring lessons, and generating quiz questions tailored to the target audience.
2. *Content Quality Analysis:* Analysing uploaded courses for clarity, engagement, and relevance, providing actionable feedback for improvement.
3. *Adaptive Learning Experiences:* Monitoring student's progress and dynamically adjust course content or quizzes to better suit individual learning paces.

Below are the dataset descriptions and how they can be used to achieve the project goals with their specific usage during training.

## *1. Course Content Suggestions*
*Goal*: To help tutors design high-quality educational materials by analyzing trends, student needs, and curriculum standards.

### *Datasets and Usage*:
1. *[Huggingface Coursera Course Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/azrai99/coursera-course-dataset)*
   The Coursera Course Dataset by azrai99 on Hugging Face contains structured data on Coursera courses, including titles, descriptions, instructors, ratings, enrollment numbers, and categories. It can be used for content recommendation, content quality analysis, and trend identification in online learning.

2. *[Kaggle AI Course Syllabi Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabdulhakim/ai-course-syllabi)*
   The AI Course Syllabi Dataset on Kaggle contains curated syllabi from various AI courses, including topics, learning objectives, and course structures. It is useful for analyzing AI education trends, generating course content suggestions, and designing adaptive learning experiences.

3. *[Kaggle Student Engagement Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/student-engagement-with-tableau-a-data-science-p)*
   The dataset contains the course titles, the course ratings, the date the course was rated, the exam category, the exam duration, whether the answer was correct or not, the number of quizzes completed, the number of exams completed, the number of lessons completed, the date engaged, the exam result, and more. It is useful for analyzing learning behaviors, improving course content, and developing adaptive learning experiences.

## *2. Content Quality Analysis*
*Goal*: To enhance the quality of online courses by providing automated, data-driven insights that help educators refine their content, making it more engaging and effective for learners.

### *Datasets and Usage*:
1. *[Kaggle Student Evaluation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dimitriosthomaidis/student-evaluation)*
   This dataset contains evaluation data for students at a tutoring center. The evaluations are based on various behavioral and academic aspects of students' participation and performance throughout a semester. The dataset includes responses to a set of questions from the students, recorded during three separate evaluations (typically conducted at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester). It can be used to analyze teaching effectiveness, course quality, and factors influencing student satisfaction.

2. *[Kaggle Bloom's Taxonomy Questions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilyasvarshavskiy/revised-blooms-taxonomy-questions)*
   The dataset contains categorized questions based on Bloom's Taxonomy, which is widely used in education to assess different cognitive skill levels. It can be useful for generating and analyzing educational assessments, structuring quizzes, and improving course content quality.

3. *[Kaggle Curriculum Analysis & Outcome Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pandey881062/dataset-for-curriculum-analysis-outcome-analysis)*
   The dataset contains information related to course curricula and student outcomes. It can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different curricula, analyze learning outcomes, and improve course content based on performance trends.

4. *[Kaggle Open University Learning Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/open-university-learning-analytics-dataset)*
   This dataset contains student interactions, demographic data, and academic performance records, enabling predictive analytics for student success and dropout risks. It supports research on personalized learning paths, course content structure optimization, and behavioral analysis in online education.

## *3. Adaptive Learning Experiences*
*Goal*: To enhance student learning by providing a tailored educational experience that adapts to each learner's pace and needs, improving engagement, satisfaction, and academic success.

### *Datasets and Usage*:
1. *[Kaggle Student Engagement Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/student-engagement-dataset)*
    The dataset provides records of student interactions with online learning platforms, categorizing engagement levels as Inactive, Sparsely Involved, or Highly Involved. It is useful for building models that analyze student behavior, predict engagement trends, and enhance adaptive learning experiences. 

2. *[Huggingface Programming Enthusiasts DB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/infinite-dataset-hub/ProgrammingEnthusiastsDB)*
   The Programming Enthusiasts DB dataset contains information related to programming learners, including their skills, interests, learning progress, and engagement with educational resources. It can be used for personalized learning recommendations, skill gap analysis, and adaptive learning models.

3. *[Kaggle English Learning Experience Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/college-english-learning-experience-dataset)*
   This dataset provides insights into college students' English learning experiences, including demographics, proficiency scores, learning preferences, engagement, and performance metrics. It is useful for developing AI-driven personalized learning models, predicting student success, and optimizing adaptive learning strategies.
